This project is not maintained anymore, and Angular has made PWA support much easier in V6. Check this guide, it's so much easier than this: https://pwa.ng/

# angular-pwa-starter
Lightweight starter 'ng new' with added app shell features (sw-precache, web app manifest).

Based on the excellent [article by Houssein Djirdeh on PWAs.](https://houssein.me/progressive-angular-applications) Check out his working PWA for hackernews here: https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/angular2-hn. Huge kudos!

4+ versions of Angular are likely to incorporate all of these features. Until then, this is intended to be an upgraded `ng new <project-name>`.

This is without `ng eject`! Ejecting the webpack config provides with much deeper customisation, but that is not the scope of this starter kit.

```
# ng -v

Create a build and the service workers required with `npm run build`.

TODO: add `sw-toolbox` and investigate `angular-universal`.
